## Coordination Points

### Dev 1 â†” Dev 2
- **API Endpoints**: Dev 2 needs to know what data is available from Dev 1's API
- **Form Submissions**: Coordinate on validation (client vs server)
- **Error Handling**: Ensure error messages are user-friendly

### Dev 1 â†” Dev 3
- **Map Data API**: Dev 3 fetches from `/api/polling-places` endpoint
- **Performance**: If map is slow with many markers, discuss optimization
- **Real-time Updates**: If adding live updates, coordinate on API

### Dev 2 â†” Dev 3
- **Styling Consistency**: Use same CSS variables and classes
- **Responsive Design**: Coordinate on breakpoints and mobile layout
- **Accessibility**: Share ARIA labels and keyboard navigation patterns

## Testing Checklist (All Devs)

At the end of 8 hours, verify:

- [ ] Login works (admin/demo)
- [ ] Can view polling places list
- [ ] Can filter by county and risk score
- [ ] Can sort by different columns
- [ ] Can view polling place detail page
- [ ] Can see reports on detail page
- [ ] Map loads with all markers
- [ ] Markers are color-coded correctly
- [ ] Clicking marker shows popup
- [ ] Can submit a new report
- [ ] Report appears on detail page
- [ ] All pages work on mobile
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Acceptable color contrast
- [ ] Can navigate with keyboard

## Demo Preparation

**Practice demonstrating:**
1. Login flow
2. Browse polling places with filters
3. Click high-risk location
4. View details and existing reports
5. Submit a new report
6. View location on map
7. Use map to find locations by risk level
8. Show mobile responsiveness

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Map not loading
- Check console for errors
- Verify `/api/polling-places` returns data
- Check Leaflet.js loaded correctly

### Styles not applying
- Clear browser cache
- Check CSS file path in template
- Verify static files are being served

### Forms not submitting
- Check CSRF token if added
- Verify form action URL
- Check for JavaScript errors

### Mobile issues
- Test on real device if possible
- Use Chrome DevTools device emulation
- Check viewport meta tag is present

## Time-Saving Tips

1. **Don't reinvent**: Use Bootstrap components when possible
2. **Test frequently**: Don't wait until the end
3. **Ask for help**: Communicate with other devs
4. **Focus on core**: Polish is secondary to functionality
5. **Use examples**: Reference Bootstrap documentation
6. **Mobile first**: Test mobile early, not at the end

## Success Criteria

After 8 hours, the prototype should:
- âœ… Run without errors
- âœ… Demonstrate core concept clearly
- âœ… Show all key features working
- âœ… Be mobile-responsive
- âœ… Have basic accessibility features
- âœ… Look professional (not polished, but clean)
- âœ… Use real-looking mock data

Good luck! ðŸš€
